*Central Color Palette* (CCP) is a WordPress plugin that gives you the ability to manage a site-wide central color palette for an uniform look and feel. The palette of the new block editor and the Theme Customizer are supported, as well as the classic editor. You can define this central color palette through the settings menu. All plugins that make use of WordPress' color picker can benefit from this plugin as well.

Multi-site WordPress installations are supported.

*Central Color Palette* replaces the color picker for choosing a text or background color found inside the classic editor with a bigger and customizable color grid.

You can export and import your palette settings and colors for an easy migration between WordPress installations.

## API Documentation

Central Color Palette offers some methods, so have a look at the [API Documentation](https://kungtiger.github.io/central-color-palette).

## Installation

There are three (3) ways to install this WordPress plugin: automatically, upload, or manually.

### Install Method 1: Automatic Installation

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser.

1. Log into your WordPress dashboard.
1. Navigate to **Plugins > Add New**.
1. Where it says "Keyword" in a dropdown, change it to "Author"
1. In the search form, type `TessaWatkinsLLC` (results may begin populating as you type but my plugins will only show when the full name is there)
1. Once you've found this plugin in the search results that appear, click the **Install Now** button and wait for the installation process to complete.
1. Once the installation process is completed, click the **Activate** button to activate the plugin.

### Install Method 2: Upload via WordPress Admin

This method is a little more involved. You don't need to leave your web browser, but you'll need to download and then upload the files yourself.

1. [Download this plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/kt-tinymce-color-grid/) from WordPress.org; it will be in the form of a zip file.
1. Log in to your WordPress dashboard.
1. Navigate to **Plugins > Add New**.
1. Click the **Upload Plugin** button at the top of the screen.
1. Select the zip file from your local file system that was downloaded in step 1.
1. Click the **Install Now** button and wait for the installation process to complete.
1. Once the installation process is completed, click the **Activate** button to activate the plugin.

### Install Method 3: Manual Installation

This method is the most involved as it requires you to be familiar with the process of transferring files using an SFTP client.

1. [Download this plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/kt-tinymce-color-grid/) from WordPress.org; it will be in the form of a zip file.
1. Unzip the contents; you should have a single folder named `kt-tinymce-color-grid`.
1. Connect to your WordPress server with your favorite SFTP client.
1. Copy the folder from step 2 to the `/wp-content/plugins/` folder in your WordPress directory. Once the folder and all of its files are there, installation is complete.
1. Now log in to your WordPress dashboard.
1. Navigate to **Plugins > Installed Plugins**. You should now see my plugin in your list.
1. Click the **Activate** button that appeared to activate it.
